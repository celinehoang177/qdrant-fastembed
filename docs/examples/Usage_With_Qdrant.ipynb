    "# Usage With Qdrant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use FastEmbed and Qdrant to perform vector search and retrieval. Qdrant is an open-source vector similarity search engine that is used to store, organize, and query collections of high-dimensional vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Qdrant to add a collection of documents to the engine and then query the collection to retrieve the most relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup: Installing necessary packages, including the Qdrant Client and FastEmbed.\n",
    "2. Importing Libraries: Importing FastEmbed and other libraries\n",
    "3. Data Preparation: Example data and embedding generation\n",
    "4. Querying: Defining a function to search documents based on a query\n",
    "5. Running Queries: Running example queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install the dependencies. `fastembed` to create embeddings and perform retrieval, and `qdrant-client` to interact with the Qdrant database."
